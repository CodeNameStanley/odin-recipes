        <h1>Tuscan Fish Stew</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I spent a few days in Florence about 30 years ago, and while I don't remember much, I do recall my surprise at how delicious the Tuscan fish stew was. What I found so interesting was how herbs like oregano, sage, and rosemary, which I'd only associated with meat, were also used with seafood. Also, FYI just in case any old-school Tuscans are coming over: I hear that for this to qualify as an official Italian fish stew you need use at least 5 different types of seafood, which is both insane and adorable. Serve with crusty bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 cup clam juice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
            <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
            <li>2 pinches red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>12 ounces halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>1 pinch minced fresh rosemary</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Puree cherry tomatoes and clam juice in a blender until smooth. Press mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, green onions, garlic, anchovy, and 1 pinch red pepper flakes in a cold plan. Place over medium heat. Cook and stir until garlic and onions just start to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato mixture. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer stew until color deepens, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add halibut and shrimp to the stew. Season with salt. Increase heat to high. Cover pan and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Pour stew into a warm bowl. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and sprinkle 1 pinch red pepper flakes on top. Serve with crusty bread.</li>
